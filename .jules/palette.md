## 2024-08-01 - Real-time Feedback for Rich Text Fields
**Learning:** Adding a character counter to a Payload CMS `richText` (Lexical) field provides immediate, valuable feedback to editors, but it's not straightforward. The field's value is a JSON object, so a simple string length check is inaccurate. The correct approach is to use the `@payloadcms/richtext-lexical/plaintext` utility to convert the editor's state to a plain text string for an accurate count.
**Action:** When a rich text field has a suggested length limit, create a custom admin component that uses the `useField` hook and `convertLexicalToPlaintext` to display a live character count. This small addition significantly improves the content editing experience by preventing guesswork.
