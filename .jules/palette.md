## 2024-05-23 - Use Themed CSS Variables for UI Consistency
**Learning:** Custom React components in the Payload admin UI should use the framework's CSS variables (e.g., `var(--theme-error-500)`) for styling to ensure consistency with the current theme, instead of using hardcoded color values. This makes the UI more robust and adaptable to theme changes.
**Action:** When implementing custom components or modifying existing ones, always inspect the available CSS variables and use them to ensure a consistent and professional look.
